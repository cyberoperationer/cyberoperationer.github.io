Artificial intelligence is advancing at an unprecedented pace. A 2019 [report](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252475371/Stanford-University-finds-that-AI-is-outpacing-Moores-Law) by Stanford, McKinsey & Company, Google, PwC, OpenAI, and others revealed that while AI performance once doubled roughly every two years—consistent with Moore’s Law—since 2012, [compute has been doubling every 3.4 months](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252475371/Stanford-University-finds-that-AI-is-outpacing-Moores-Law). This dramatic acceleration is evident not only in the frequent rollout of new models by tech giants but also in the emergence of innovative competitors.

This rapid advancement continues. Recent reports have highlighted a breakthrough: a state-of-the-art reasoning model, whose performance rivals OpenAI’s O1, was developed for [less than $50 and wastrained in just 26 minutes](https://mashable.com/article/openai-o1-reasoning-model-rival-less-than-50-dollars). Researchers achieved these cost reductions through a novel approach detailed in a recent [arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.19393). Instead of overhauling existing architectures, their method optimizes the way AI models process information at the moment of use—effectively unlocking and scaling the inherent reasoning capabilities of large pretrained models while slashing computational demands.

Adding further momentum to this trend is [Novasky AI’s new Sky-T1 model](https://novasky-ai.github.io/posts/sky-t1/). According to the company, Sky-T1 combines innovative training techniques with streamlined architectures to deliver scalable, on-demand reasoning capabilities at a remarkably low cost. Together, these advancements underscore a paradigm shift: affordable, fast-to-deploy, and high-performance AI is now within reach.

Yet, as with any disruptive technology, these breakthroughs present a double-edged sword. While they promise to revolutionize sectors ranging from cybersecurity to financial services by making sophisticated AI tools accessible to a broader range of users, they also raise critical security concerns. The same low-cost, high-performance systems could be exploited by threat actors enhancing their operational capabilities.

For policymakers and security strategists, this accelerating evolution in AI calls for a dual approach. On one hand, regulatory policies must be developed to mitigate misuse and protecting against emerging threats. On the other, strategic investments in innovative AI for deterrence and defense are essential to counterbalance adversarial capabilities.

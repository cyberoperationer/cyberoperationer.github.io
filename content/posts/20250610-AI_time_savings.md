A recent [UK Government AI experiment](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/landmark-government-trial-shows-ai-could-save-civil-servants-nearly-2-weeks-a-year) revealed that certain tasks can be fully automated, saving up to **13 working days per person annually**.

The results are documented in two reports: [*Mapping the Potential*](https://www.turing.ac.uk/news/publications/mapping-potential-generative-ai-and-public-sector-work-using-time-use-data) by the Alan Turing Institute, and The [Government Digital Service’s](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/microsoft-365-copilot-experiment-cross-government-findings-report) cross-government experiment of **Microsoft 365 Copilot**  

Between September and December 2024, **20,000 UK civil servants** participated in the trial. The findings identified **four fully automatable activities**:

- Organising meetings and meeting administration  
- Creating or updating appointments or bookings  
- Completing or processing forms  
- Creating or updating records, databases, or case files  

# Key Insights from the Experiment

- **82%** of users expressed a preference not to return to pre-AI workflows.  
- **Time savings** were highest in:
  - Document drafting: *up to 24 minutes/day*
  - Presentation preparation: *19 minutes/day*  
- On average, **13 working days** were saved per person annually—equivalent to **1,000 working years** saved across all participants (assuming a 260-day working year).

# Economic Implications

[The 2024 median annual salary for a UK civil servant was **£33,980**.](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/civil-service-statistics-2024/statistical-bulletin-civil-service-statistics-2024#:~:text=The%20median%20salary%20in%20the,of%20£2%2C060%20(6.5%25).) For 20,000 staff, the **total annual payroll** equates to:
20,000 × £33,980 = £679,600,000


Assuming a 260-day working year, the **daily cost per civil servant** is:
£33,980 ÷ 260 ≈ £130.69


A 13-day annual saving per person translates to:
13 × £130.69 ≈ £1,699 per person/year


For 20,000 civil servants, the total annual saving is:
20,000 × £1,699 ≈ £33,980,000


# Some Policy Implications

- **Reallocation** of budgetary resources to other priority areas  
- **Reskilling** staff for roles where AI still requires a human-in-the-loop  
- **Faster public service delivery**, enabled by freeing up 13 working days per employee

This AI experiment demonstrates tangible productivity gains but also invites deeper reflection on how public-sector roles might evolve in the years to come.

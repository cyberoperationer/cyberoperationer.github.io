### Cyber Security, Definitions and Agencies
Cyber Security is a fundamental pillar and of utmost importance to secure our reliance on interconnected information systems in networks of networks facilitated by information and telecommunication technologies. Supervising two extraordinary individuals participating in the Leadership in International Security Course (LISC), a highly competitive eight-month course in international security designed for high-performing professionals seeking to enhance their careers and effectively respond to the world's most pressing security challenges, has been a transformative journey: a journey where it not only underlines the importance of not only cyber security but also the invaluable role of guidance and supervision in updating and deepening the knowledge of the participants in the cyber security policy field.

Cyber Security has many definitions; some include process, people and technology, others focus on the technology level, such as protecting computers, electronic communication systems, services etc., and others focus on the policy level. Regardless of level, organisations must ensure their systems are cyber secure against cyber threat actors and related attacks. Organisations with insecure systems risk, for example, ransomware attacks. The implications can be devastating, from losing trust, their brand taking damage, or even threatening national security.

Intelligence communities, agencies responsible for cyber security, and private sector companies in the cyber security industry constantly present reports on the threat landscape. Firstly, the threat level is high in cyberspace because connected assets are always online and accessible, which means attackers can always target them. Second, threat actors, especially those in the Ransomeware-as-a-Service (RaaS)-sector, constantly seek ways to penetrate systems. Therefore, cyber security is a continuously shifting field requiring a highly skilled workforce. Therefore, cyber security is a continually shifting field requiring a highly skilled workforce. The importance of supervision becomes evident in this context.

### The Role of Supervision
Over the eight-month LISC course, two brilliant LISC participants chose their respective cybersecurity-related topics, and I had the privilege of supervising them. The role of supervision is not only to impart knowledge; it is also about acting as a guide and mentor, and [source of information](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/teaching-learning/publications/2019/aug/research-and-project-supervision-all-levels-introduction)


### The Importance of Individual Cyber Security Policy Research

Under my supervision, the two LISC participants began their individual journeys. The first focused on "Digital and Technological Sovereignty of the European Union", with a background on how technology and related components increasingly impact national security, providing challenges and opportunities for the EU and policy recommendations. The second focused on "Public-Private Partnerships in Cybersecurity" for successful collective cybersecurity by applying complexity theory in public-private partnerships and interviewing key stakeholders to present relevant policy recommendations.

Their research underscores the many facets and perspectives in cyber security. Each challenge requires unique approaches, and each participant's existing training, education, and expertise, augmented by the LISC program, can provide novel and relevant policy recommendations. The beauty of supervision lies in its ability to allow me to guide and support LISC participants as they delve into their unique paths, providing a significant, original contribution to cyber security policy knowledge.

### Conclusions
Technological advancements are occurring at exponential rates, so we cannot overstate the importance of cyber security and the role of dedicated "pracademic" (= professional and academic) supervision. Through guidance, mentorship and active engagement, we can identify and support the next generation of cyber security policy experts that ensure the safety and security of cyberspace. It has been an honour to guide these two future leaders in cyber security policy.
I look forward to their contributions to their organisations and countries for national and international security.

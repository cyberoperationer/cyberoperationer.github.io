### [My latest article](https://papers.academic-conferences.org/index.php/iccws/article/view/955/947) at the 19th International Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security, Towson University, raises the question what is the current state of digital geopolitics?

There is no technology that has transformed societies in the ways that information- and telecommunications technology (ITC) has. The increased pace of digitalization has opened opportunities to conduct e-commerce, e-governance, streamline processes, but also transformed intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and command and control of joint military operations.

There needs to be more research on the topic. It is essential to review the scientific literature and see what has previously done. 

The review shows cyberspace affects all domains of human life and the political, military, economic, social, information and infrastructure systems and subsystems. Technology and Information are the two key areas that are affecting digital geopolitics.

The article aims to raise awareness among policymakers, authorities, and the public about how technologies are used for disinformation, foreign interference, and freedom of expression.

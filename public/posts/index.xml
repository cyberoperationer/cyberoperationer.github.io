<h3 id="on-24-april-2023-the-us-director-of-national-intelligence-dni-dr-avril-haines-was-invited-to-a-public-conversation-with-carnegies-dan-baer-on-combatting-digital-authoritarianism-this-is-a-summary-of-her-presentation-the-entire-presentation-including-the-qa-session-is-on-carnegie-endowments-youtube-pagehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmd64c-dunyo">On 24 April 2023, The US Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Dr. Avril Haines was invited to a public conversation with Carnegie’s Dan Baer on combatting digital authoritarianism. This is a summary of her presentation. The entire presentation including the Q&amp;A session is on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD64C-DUNYo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Carnegie Endowment&rsquo;s YouTube-page</a>.</h3>
<p>Today, democracy is increasingly challenged by autocratic leaders that contest over information, defined as “the increasing use of digital technology to promote authoritarianism.” The DNI highlighted the importance of intellectual exchange between the intelligence community and think tanks like Carnegie Endowment to “challenge our thinking and work to ensure that we are focused on what matters, and not missing the broader strategic pictures.” This collaboration is especially fruitful in understanding the landscape, addressing the problem, and focus in one aspect of a problem.</p>
<p>The aspect the DNI was commenting was “the degree to which new technologies, institutional, legal, and organisational approaches to digital repression being deployed by authoritarian governments and exported to other countries are advancing authoritarianism and undermining democratic governance globally.”</p>
<p>The DNI covered seven themes in her presentation. First, the distinction between an intelligence service in a democracy versus an authoritarian state. Second, why digital repression is a critical threat to national security. Third, how foreign governments are “increasingly using digital information and communication technologies to monitor and suppress political debate domestically as well as in their expat and diaspora communities abroad.” Fourth, describing the Russian, Chinese and Iranian models and methods “that are being exported.” Fifth, how governments are increasingly using spyware to “target political opponents and critics.” Sixth, how governments are using technologies to limit user access to information. Finally, the DNI describes how the intelligence community “alongside the private sector and research institutions can help to create greater awareness regarding the types of technologies as well as the institutional legal and organisational approaches being used to engage in digital repression.”</p>
<h3 id="intelligence-services-in-democracies-vs-an-authoritarian-state">Intelligence services in democracies vs. an authoritarian State</h3>
<p>According to the DNI, Intelligence services in democracies:
“are subject to democratically passed laws, have internal and external safeguards in place and ultimately are held accountable to oversight mechanisms that work to ensure we remain legal, ethical, and focused on providing the best intelligence to help decision makers in our government make better national security and foreign policy decisions while being protective of people&rsquo;s civil liberties and privacy.”</p>
<p>In authoritarian countries, intelligence services are “often used as tools of the state to enhance digital repression under the direction of their rulers.”</p>
<p>Why is Digital Repression a Critical Threat to National Security?
Authoritarian States are increasingly using digital technology to promote authoritarianism. Free flows of information pose a threat and authoritarian countries were early concerned with the Internet and the implications of free flows of information. The Arab Spring uprising “served as a turning point when authoritarian governments came to recognise that their public’s digital connectivity posed an existential threat to their grip on power.” Therefore, using digital technologies to control the flows of information, eliminate dissent, remould society, conduct mass surveillance, spread disinformation, misinformation, and propaganda, and use spyware to suppress voices and debate, authoritarian States are exporting authoritarianism which is a risk to the integrity of democracy and democratic societies.</p>
<h3 id="china">China</h3>
<p>The People&rsquo;s Republic of China (PRC) is a “global leader in digital repression”, topping Freedom House&rsquo;s list of countries with the least internet freedom for eight consecutive years. China excels at censoring digital information and surveilling its population due to early prioritization of digital controls. The PRC uses digital repression to prevent challenges to its rule, eliminate dissent, and reshape society for national rejuvenation.</p>
<p>China presents its use of digital repression tools as features, controlling information flow and limiting citizen access to information that may undermine the government&rsquo;s legitimacy. The country exports its technology and know-how, enabling transnational repression and assisting other governments in digital repression within their borders.</p>
<p>Chinese smart cities integrate surveillance technology with public goods provision, such as traffic safety, to exert authoritarian control. The PRC is also the leading perpetrator of transnational repression, often through digital means, with its Operation Fox Hunt initiative. Recently, the EU&rsquo;s Department of Justice charged PRC police officers for using fake social media accounts to spread propaganda and harass dissidents in the United States.</p>
<h3 id="russia">Russia</h3>
<p>Russia is also a leading perpetrator of digital repression, taking a different approach from China by relying on complex legal and institutional structures to control information. It has been particularly active in spreading disinformation since the start of Putin&rsquo;s illegal invasion of Ukraine. Internet freedom in Russia is the 6th least free globally and reached an all-time low last year.</p>
<p>The Kremlin has blocked social media sites and thousands of websites and introduced harsh penalties for spreading “false” information about the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Moscow has pressured foreign IT giants to abide by its content moderation requirements, resulting in increased self-censorship and withdrawal from the Russian media space. The expansion of Kremlin-aligned media corporations, such as VKontakte&rsquo;s acquisition of Yandex, has given the government greater control over online content.</p>
<p>In 2022, Moscow required foreign IT and media companies with significant Russian user bases to maintain local offices and comply with Russian laws. The government has encouraged the development of indigenous platforms to replace foreign social media companies, allowing for increased content control. Russia has also undermined internet freedom in Ukraine through internet shutdowns, cyberattacks, targeted airstrikes, and dismantling of telecommunications infrastructure.</p>
<p>A Russia-based influence operation in Ukraine was discovered last September, involving over 60 websites impersonating news organizations and accounts on major U.S. social media platforms.</p>
<h3 id="iran">Iran</h3>
<p>Iran imposes Internet shutdowns to stop protests, such as during the protests after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody. During the protests, Iran conducted 18 Internet shutdowns. Furthermore, Iran has presented its intent and capability to use proxies such as an Eastern European criminal organisation to suppress dissidents by murdering them: a human rights activist was murdered after criticizing Iran’s treatment of women.</p>
<h3 id="other-tactics-techniques-and-procedures-ttps">Other Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTPs)</h3>
<p>Other countries are adopting the approaches mentioned for digital repression. Additional tactics include the tactic of internet shutdowns, blocking websites, using commercial spyware, to provide only access “to an online space that mirrors the views of their government and its interests”, limiting “users access to information sources located outside of their borders”, monitoring populations and “potentially manipulate control and exploit information based on the insights gained from the” vast amounts of data created by billions and trillions of internet of things-devices connected to smart city initiatives, and exploiting facial recognition AI to quell political unrest.</p>
<h3 id="the-response-to-digital-repression">The Response to Digital Repression</h3>
<p>Collaboration between the intelligence community, private sector, and research institutions is crucial. Raising awareness about technologies and approaches used for digital repression, we can help develop normative frameworks that preserve the positive potential for these technologies while guarding against their repressive uses. This should include promoting technical standards and design approaches that support cybersecurity, democratic governance, freedom of expression, and political discourse, while acknowledging the risks associated with vast data collection. In addition, modern laws and organizational structures are needed to make digital repression more difficult. As certain governments become more adept at using repressive technologies, urgent action is required to address the growing sophistication of automated surveillance and identity resolution techniques.</p>
<p>Digital repression and foreign malign influence are whole-of-society challenges that require a unified response to protect the integrity of democratic societies worldwide.</p>
<h3 id="a-detailed-model-of-digital-repression">A Detailed Model of Digital Repression</h3>
<p>This section presents a detailed model of digital repression based on the presentation.
</p>
<p>Due to China being an earlier adopter of Digital Controls, it is more mature in controlling information flows. Russia, on the other hand, is working to get there. Finally, Iran will likely need a higher level of maturity in digital controls and therefore currently relies on simply shutting down their portion of the internet combined with deterrence by punishment and fear manifesting in for example, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2022/oct/31/mapping-irans-unrest-how-mahsa-aminis-death-led-to-nationwide-protests" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">crackdowns</a>.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="on-16-march-2023-the-uk-cabinet-office-announced-that-the-social-media-app-tiktok-is-banned-on-government-electronic-deviceshttpswwwgovukgovernmentnewstiktok-banned-on-uk-government-devices-as-part-of-wider-app-review-the-reason"><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tiktok-banned-on-uk-government-devices-as-part-of-wider-app-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">On 16 March 2023, the U.K. Cabinet Office announced that the social media app TikTok is banned on government electronic devices</a>. The reason?</h1>
<h3 id="a-security-review-ordered-by-the-cabinet-office-ministers-aimed-to-look-at-the-potential-vulnerability-of-government-data-from-social-media-apps-on-devices-and-risks-around-how-sensitive-information-could-be-accessed-and-used-by-some-platforms">A security review ordered by the Cabinet Office Ministers aimed to look “at the potential vulnerability of government data from social media apps on devices and risks around how sensitive information could be accessed and used by some platforms.”</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2023/03/17/which-countries-have-banned-tiktok-cybersecurity-data-privacy-espionage-fears" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Euronews</a> reported on 17 March 2023 that in addition to the U.K., “New Zealand, The European Parliament, European Commission, and the E.U. Council,…, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, India, Taiwan, and the United States” have banned TikTok from government devices. Euronews reports that Afghanistan and Pakistan have also banned the app.</p>
<p>Their concerns are warranted.</p>
<p>On 4 July 2022, <a href="https://internet2-0.com/technical-analysis-of-tiktok-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">internet2.0</a> presented the “Technical Analysis of TikTok App.” Their media release provided a link to <a href="https://penetrum.com/tiktok/Penetrum_TikTok_Security_Analysis_whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Penetrum</a>, who conducted a Security Analysis on TikTok. Security Analysis is a process of identifying vulnerabilities in software, how potential attackers can use those vulnerabilities to their advantage, and recommending security mitigating measures to mitigate those vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>In their report, Penetrum found that “after extensive research, we have found that not only is TikTok a massive security flaw waiting to happen, but the ties that they have to Chinese parties and Chinese ISP’s make it a very vulnerable source of data.”</p>
<p><a href="https://penetrum.com/tiktok/Penetrum_TikTok_Security_Analysis_whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">According to the report</a>, TikTok collects the following user data:
“</p>
<ul>
<li>IMEI number of a phone,</li>
<li>Screen Resolution,</li>
<li>SIM card provider</li>
<li>Tracks the smartphone’s location</li>
<li>Collects GPS coordinates</li>
<li>Collects WiFi location and SSID-changes</li>
<li>Collects Mobile Cell Data</li>
<li>O.S. version</li>
<li>Full lists of mobile contacts</li>
<li>SMS logs</li>
<li>IMSI numbers</li>
<li>Smartphone model</li>
<li>Smartphone version</li>
<li>Stored app data from previous installations, and</li>
<li>Memory data”</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the report, this amount of data “creates an extremely realistic and graphic fingerprint of your phone which can be used to determine everything you have installed.” Furthermore, “the IMSI which is used to follow users while getting a new phone, basically while transferring your SIM data to a new phone, the IMSI number stays with you.” This enables the application owner to “create a profile on you.” The report states that “TikTok does an excessive amount of tracking on it’s users, and that the data collected is partially if not fully stored on Chinese servers”</p>
<p>In addition to the information collected by the application, the report presents several “Security Concerns of Downloading TikTok.” In more detail, the following:</p>
<p>“</p>
<ul>
<li>Execution of O.S. commands</li>
<li>Insecure cryptography usage</li>
<li>Potential SQL injection code from user defined variables</li>
<li>Storing of API tokens</li>
<li>Webview enabled by default along with insecure webview enabled”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-does-all-of-the-above-mean">What does all of the above mean?</h3>
<p>It means that TikTok has vulnerabilities that, if known by someone “who figures out how to enable and leverage this capability of this app, can use it or execute man in the middle attacks.” Why? Because the vulnerabilities mentioned in the report can potentially load files on the smartphone, “which in theory can lead to malware being loaded from inside the application, chained with remote debugging to see what fails in your malware. It also allows a very big window for attackers to not only upload, but execute, and debug their malware as well(in almost real time).” To Penetrum “this seems like an extreme security risk that shouldn’t be taken lightly.”</p>
<p>If the conclusions of the Security Analysis report are accurate, then the concerns that Governments have had about security risks to government information are warranted. However, if the findings are accurate, government staff are profiled and constantly tracked. This could mean a potential adversary could plan, prepare, and execute intelligence operations to recruit government staff as spies.</p>
<p>Based on <a href="https://penetrum.com/tiktok/Penetrum_TikTok_Security_Analysis_whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Penetrum’s Security Analysis report</a>, if accurate, TikTok could be considered an intelligence collection tool to collect government information and profile, government staff. A threat actor could use this intelligence to always stay one step ahead of, for example, the U.K. government in political, military, economic, social, infrastructure, and information affairs. This could pose a national security risk.</p>
<p>One case that reminds of this approach is what <a href="https://americanmilitarynews.com/2020/12/china-exposed-cia-operatives-in-africa-and-europe-with-hacked-us-data-report-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">American Military News states</a>: “In 2012, China hacked a major U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) database which allowed them to expose numerous CIA spies operating in Africa and Europe.</p>
<p><a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/12/21/china-stolen-us-data-exposed-cia-operatives-spy-networks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Foreign Policy states</a>, “During the OPM breach, Chinese hackers stole detailed, often highly sensitive personnel data from 21.5 million current and former U.S. officials, their spouses, and job applicants, including health, residency, employment, fingerprint, and financial data.”</p>
<p>The difference between the OPM hack and TikTok is that current and future government staff freely provide this kind of information, especially since TikTok collects all of the information, as noted above. At the same time, those aware of TikTok’s capabilities can conduct eavesdropping attacks and not need to “hack” into government databases (although if vulnerabilities exist, that is also likely to happen).</p>
<p>Therefore, the U.K. Cabinet Office announcing a “<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tiktok-banned-on-uk-government-devices-as-part-of-wider-app-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">precautionary ban on TikTok on government</a>” electronic devices does not protect only sensitive information but also government staff: current and future.</p>

<p>There is no technology that has transformed societies in the ways that information- and telecommunications technology (ITC) has. The increased pace of digitalization has opened opportunities to conduct e-commerce, e-governance, streamline processes, but also transformed intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and command and control of joint military operations.</p>
<p>There needs to be more research on the topic. It is essential to review the scientific literature and see what has previously done.</p>
<p>The review shows cyberspace affects all domains of human life and the political, military, economic, social, information and infrastructure systems and subsystems. Technology and Information are the two key areas that are affecting digital geopolitics.</p>
<p>The article aims to raise awareness among policymakers, authorities, and the public about how technologies are used for disinformation, foreign interference, and freedom of expression.</p>

<p>Offensive cyberspace operations are actions taken by an organized group of people with a defined purpose. The purpose is to take down an adversary’s devices, infrastructure, and tools. By taking the fight to the adversary, it may be possible to make them switch stance: from conducting attacks to defending themselves. These actions ensure cyber security.</p>
<p>There needs to be more research on the topic. It is essential to review the scientific literature and see what previous researchers have done and their thoughts at that time. Much information exists today thanks to mainstream media reporting on the topic. And this reporting is thanks to government agencies successfully halting adversary attacks.</p>

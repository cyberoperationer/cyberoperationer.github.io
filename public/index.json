Examples of a well-designed deterrence strategy can be found in the US, the EU and Australia. In light of the recent ransomware attack that affected more than 120 authorities and businesses, this should also be considered for Sweden. The ransomware attacks against Coop, Kalix municipality, the Church of Sweden and TietoEvry highlight the urgent need to deter cyber threats. The attacks have had a significant impact on Swedes’ daily lives, economic interests and, by extension, Swedish security. The situation emphasises the importance of Swedish policies that increase the costs and risks for threat actors and make it clear that it does not pay to attack Swedish interests. Bill 2020/21:30 discusses the need to strengthen cyber defence capabilities, both defensively and offensively. The focus on deterring cyber threats is limited. The Defence Committee’s report “Kraftsamling” deals with deterrence for security in the Euro-Atlantic area, including Sweden’s role in NATO, but not Sweden’s own cyber deterrence. What can be done? To deal with cyber threats, such as ransomware attacks, we should understand that Swedish interests are under continuous attack over time, and Sweden is constantly dealing with threats in cyberspace. This emphasises the importance of cyber deterrence, as illustrated by the 2014 Sony hack and the Colonial Pipeline attack. The cyber attack on Sony Pictures, triggered by the film ‘The Interview’ and its fictional plot against the North Korean leader, led to international controversy and questions about US cyber deterrence. Admiral Michael S. Rogers of the US Cyber Command emphasised the global impact of the attack. In response, the US government under President Obama developed a new cyber security policy and sanctions against individuals involved in cyber attacks, which was an important step in addressing cyber threats. The Colonial Pipeline case, a major ransomware attack, led to fuel shortages, price increases and panic buying in the US. The US launched a comprehensive government effort to restore operations and mitigate the impact on the energy sector and the public. General Paul Nakasone of the US Cyber Command emphasised the strategic importance of the attack and the coordinated response of the Cyber National Mission Force and other government agencies and international partners to combat such threats. International cooperation is essential to tackle cyber threats. Many countries face the challenge of identifying and acting against threat actors, but cooperation has proven effective in imposing sanctions. For example, negotiations between the US and Russia led to the arrest of an individual behind the Colonial Pipeline attack after months of dialogue. The EU has imposed sanctions on those responsible for cyber attacks such as ‘WannaCry’ and ‘NotPetya’, including travel bans and asset freezes. ENISA, the EU’s cybersecurity agency, and Europol’s EC3, which fights cybercrime, play an important role in helping member states improve their ability to deal with cyber threats, contributing to a stronger common front against cyber attacks. Australia has imposed sanctions on a Russian following an international investigation involving the FBI, NSA and GCHQ for a cyber attack on “Medibank Private”. General Nakasone emphasises “integrated deterrence” as a strategy, meaning coordination of offensive cyber operations and collaboration across different arenas and partners, which is important in a world of continuous geopolitical competition. Based on the above, the following lessons emerge: Cyber deterrence requires a society-wide cyber strategy and responsibility from decision-makers, where offensive cyber operations can also be undertaken with the sup","date":"2024-02-28","objectID":"/2024/there-is-no-clear-cybersecurity-policy/:0:1","tags":null,"title":"There is no clear cybersecurity policy","uri":"/2024/there-is-no-clear-cybersecurity-policy/"},{"categories":null,"content":" Note to readers: I was scheduled to participate in the panel discussion at the CyberPeace Summit 2023. However, due to unforeseen timing constraints and prior obligations that I could not reschedule, I was regrettably unable to present my intervention. As I believe the contents of this speech are critical and worth sharing, I have decided to publish it here for the broader audience. While I wasn’t able to deliver these thoughts virtually, I hope they provide value and insight to those interested in the topic. Ladies and Gentlemen, Esteemed delegates, Good morning. Good day and afternoon. I want to thank the Global CyberPeace Summit and Dialogues for organising and hosting this important event. As the title of this panel states, Internet Governance and Cyber Policy Dialogue have a role to play in ensuring an open and resilient cyberspace that benefits all humankind. Today, I will highlight incidents and their consequences, discuss cyber diplomacy, and touch upon digital geopolitics. The critical interplay between diplomacy and cyberspace will become more evident by the end. This is more critical than you may think: Imagine if threat actors could infiltrate companies managing the IT of thousands of clients. In 2017, a report was released detailing cyber espionage campaigns of another country. The report uses various analysis methods to attribute the cyber espionage campaign to a specific threat actor. The attackers targeted companies that manage their customer’s IT and systems. These companies, also known as managed systems providers, have access to their customer’s networks. As you can imagine, managed systems providers are very lucrative targets for cyber espionage attacks. According to the report, once a threat actor has gained access, and I quote, “it is likely to be relatively straightforward to exploit this and move laterally onto the networks of potentially thousands of other victims.” The targets included industries, and I quote, in “information technology, high-tech electronics, financial services, satellites and telecommunications, energy, public administration, scientific research and consulting, chemicals, and aerospace.” Another threat actor has targeted governments, private companies, the media, and other organisations. What are the implications of cyber espionage campaigns? In 2014, three world-leading companies suffered cyber espionage. In 2017, one filed for bankruptcy, one declared bankruptcy, and the third traded at less than half of pre-attack levels. Let’s discuss some other attacks. In 2021, threat actors conducted a ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline. Colonial Pipeline is the largest refined products pipeline in the United States, transporting more than 100 million gallons or 2.5 million barrels per day. Colonial transports approximately 45 per cent of all fuel consumed on the East Coast, providing refined products to more than 50 million Americans. The threat actors demanded 75 bitcoins, which were equivalent to USD 4.4 million at that time. This attack impacted the US’s political, economic, and social systems. In 2021, a private company stated that a threat actor was inside another neighbouring country’s energy and power plant’s IT systems. In 2022, just as the Russian aggression towards Ukraine began, Ukrainian agencies were hit by cyberattacks. In addition, the cyberattacks also hit satellite operator Viasat. Why? The threat actor intended to attack Ukrainian military command and control systems. However, the attack had secondary/tertiary effects by striking civilian infrastructure operated by Viasat. These examples showcase how national security interests are furthered in and through cyberspace. Cyberspace is increasingly used for cyberespionage, cyber-ransom attacks, misinformation, and disinformation campaigns, attacking the information environment and, in turn, the cognitive dimension of humans. These incidents offer a backdrop for the importance of our discussion today.

Supervising two extraordinary individuals participating in the Leadership in International Security Course (LISC), a highly competitive eight-month course in international security designed for high-performing professionals seeking to enhance their careers and effectively respond to the world’s most pressing security challenges, has been a transformative journey: a journey where it not only underlines the importance of not only cyber security but also the invaluable role of guidance and supervision in updating and deepening the knowledge of the participants in the cyber security policy field. Cyber Security has many definitions; some include process, people and technology, others focus on the technology level, such as protecting computers, electronic communication systems, services etc., and others focus on the policy level. Regardless of level, organisations must ensure their systems are cyber secure against cyber threat actors and related attacks. Organisations with insecure systems risk, for example, ransomware attacks. The implications can be devastating, from losing trust, their brand taking damage, or even threatening national security. Intelligence communities, agencies responsible for cyber security, and private sector companies in the cyber security industry constantly present reports on the threat landscape. Firstly, the threat level is high in cyberspace because connected assets are always online and accessible, which means attackers can always target them. Second, threat actors, especially those in the Ransomeware-as-a-Service (RaaS)-sector, constantly seek ways to penetrate systems. Therefore, cyber security is a continuously shifting field requiring a highly skilled workforce. Therefore, cyber security is a continually shifting field requiring a highly skilled workforce.

This is a summary of her presentation. The entire presentation including the Q\u0026A session is on Carnegie Endowment’s YouTube-page. Today, democracy is increasingly challenged by autocratic leaders that contest over information, defined as “the increasing use of digital technology to promote authoritarianism.” The DNI highlighted the importance of intellectual exchange between the intelligence community and think tanks like Carnegie Endowment to “challenge our thinking and work to ensure that we are focused on what matters, and not missing the broader strategic pictures.” This collaboration is especially fruitful in understanding the landscape, addressing the problem, and focus in one aspect of a problem. The aspect the DNI was commenting was “the degree to which new technologies, institutional, legal, and organisational approaches to digital repression being deployed by authoritarian governments and exported to other countries are advancing authoritarianism and undermining democratic governance globally.” The DNI covered seven themes in her presentation. First, the distinction between an intelligence service in a democracy versus an authoritarian state. Second, why digital repression is a critical threat to national security. Third, how foreign governments are “increasingly using digital information and communication technologies to monitor and suppress political debate domestically as well as in their expat and diaspora communities abroad.” Fourth, describing the Russian, Chinese and Iranian models and methods “that are being exported.” Fifth, how governments are increasingly using spyware to “target political opponents and critics.” Sixth, how governments are using technologies to limit user access to information.

Authoritarian States are increasingly using digital technology to promote authoritarianism. Free flows of information pose a threat and authoritarian countries were early concerned with the Internet and the implications of free flows of information. The Arab Spring uprising “served as a turning point when authoritarian governments came to recognise that their public’s digital connectivity posed an existential threat to their grip on power.” Therefore, using digital technologies to control the flows of information, eliminate dissent, remould society, conduct mass surveillance, spread disinformation, misinformation, and propaganda, and use spyware to suppress voices and debate, authoritarian States are exporting authoritarianism which is a risk to the integrity of democracy and democratic societies.

The PRC uses digital repression to prevent challenges to its rule, eliminate dissent, and reshape society for national rejuvenation. China presents its use of digital repression tools as features, controlling information flow and limiting citizen access to information that may undermine the government’s legitimacy. The country exports its technology and know-how, enabling transnational repression and assisting other governments in digital repression within their borders. Chinese smart cities integrate surveillance technology with public goods provision, such as traffic safety, to exert authoritarian control.

It has been particularly active in spreading disinformation since the start of Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine. Internet freedom in Russia is the 6th least free globally and reached an all-time low last year. The Kremlin has blocked social media sites and thousands of websites and introduced harsh penalties for spreading “false” information about the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Moscow has pressured foreign IT giants to abide by its content moderation requirements, resulting in increased self-censorship and withdrawal from the Russian media space. The expansion of Kremlin-aligned media corporations, such as VKontakte’s acquisition of Yandex, has given the government greater control over online content. In 2022, Moscow required foreign IT and media companies with significant Russian user bases to maintain local offices and comply with Russian laws. The government has encouraged the development of indigenous platforms to replace foreign social media companies, allowing for increased content control. Russia has also undermined internet freedom in Ukraine through internet shutdowns, cyberattacks, targeted airstrikes, and dismantling of telecommunications infrastructure.

Council,…, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, India, Taiwan, and the United States” have banned TikTok from government devices. Euronews reports that Afghanistan and Pakistan have also banned the app. Their concerns are warranted. On 4 July 2022, internet2.0 presented the “Technical Analysis of TikTok App.” Their media release provided a link to Penetrum, who conducted a Security Analysis on TikTok. Security Analysis is a process of identifying vulnerabilities in software, how potential attackers can use those vulnerabilities to their advantage, and recommending security mitigating measures to mitigate those vulnerabilities. In their report, Penetrum found that “after extensive research, we have found that not only is TikTok a massive security flaw waiting to happen, but the ties that they have to Chinese parties and Chinese ISP’s make it a very vulnerable source of data.” According to the report, TikTok collects the following user data: “ IMEI number of a phone, Screen Resolution, SIM card provider Tracks the smartphone’s location Collects GPS coordinates Collects WiFi location and SSID-changes Collects Mobile Cell Data O.S. version Full lists of mobile contacts SMS logs IMSI numbers Smartphone model Smartphone version Stored app data from previous installations, and Memory data” According to the report, this amount of data “creates an extremely realistic and graphic fingerprint of your phone which can be used to determine everything you have installed.” Furthermore, “the IMSI which is used to follow users while getting a new phone, basically while transferring your SIM data to a new phone, the IMSI number stays with you.” This enables the application owner to “create a profile on you.” The report states that “TikTok does an excessive amount of tracking on it’s users, and that the data collected is partially if not fully stored on Chinese servers” In addition to the information collected by the application, the report presents several “Security Concerns of Downloading TikTok.” In more detail, the following: “ Execution of O.S. commands Insecure cryptography usage Potential SQL injection code from user defined variables Storing of API tokens Webview enabled by default along with insecure webview enabled” ","date":"2023-03-20","objectID":"/2023/tiktok-banned-on-government-electronic-devices/:0:1","tags":null,"title":"TikTok banned on Government Electronic Devices","uri":"/2023/tiktok-banned-on-government-electronic-devices/"},{"categories":null,"content":"What does all of the above mean? It means that TikTok has vulnerabilities that, if known by someone “who figures out how to enable and leverage this capability of this app, can use it or execute man in the middle attacks.” Why? Because the vulnerabilities mentioned in the report can potentially load files on the smartphone, “which in theory can lead to malware being loaded from inside the application, chained with remote debugging to see what fails in your malware. It also allows a very big window for attackers to not only upload, but execute, and debug their malware as well(in almost real time).” To Penetrum “this seems like an extreme security risk that shouldn’t be taken lightly.” If the conclusions of the Security Analysis report are accurate, then the concerns that Governments have had about security risks to government information are warranted. However, if the findings are accurate, government staff are profiled and constantly tracked. This could mean a potential adversary could plan, prepare, and execute intelligence operations to recruit government staff as spies. Based on Penetrum’s Security Analysis report, if accurate, TikTok could be considered an intelligence collection tool to collect government information and profile, government staff. A threat actor could use this intelligence to always stay one step ahead of, for example, the U.K. government in political, military, economic, social, infrastructure, and information affairs. This could pose a national security risk. One case that reminds of this approach is what American Military News states: “In 2012, China hacked a major U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) database which allowed them to expose numerous CIA spies operating in Africa and Europe. Foreign Policy states, “During the OPM breach, Chinese hackers stole detailed, often highly sensitive personnel data from 21.5 million current and former U.S. officials, their spouses, and job applicants, including health, residency, employment, fingerprint, and financial data.” The difference between the OPM hack and TikTok is that current and future government staff freely provide this kind of information, especially since TikTok collects all of the information, as noted above. At the same time, those aware of TikTok’s capabilities can conduct eavesdropping attacks and not need to “hack” into government databases (although if vulnerabilities exist, that is also likely to happen). Therefore, the U.K. Cabinet Office announcing a “precautionary ban on TikTok on government” electronic devices does not protect only sensitive information but also government staff: current and future.

[{"categories":null,"content":"My latest article at the 19th International Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security, Towson University, raises the question what is the current state of digital geopolitics? There is no technology that has transformed societies in the ways that information- and telecommunications technology (ITC) has. The increased pace of digitalization has opened opportunities to conduct e-commerce, e-governance, streamline processes, but also transformed intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and command and control of joint military operations. There needs to be more research on the topic. It is essential to review the scientific literature and see what has previously done. The review shows cyberspace affects all domains of human life and the political, military, economic, social, information and infrastructure systems and subsystems. Technology and Information are the two key areas that are affecting digital geopolitics. The article aims to raise awareness among policymakers, authorities, and the public about how technologies are used for disinformation, foreign interference, and freedom of expression.

Offensive cyberspace operations are actions taken by an organized group of people with a defined purpose. The purpose is to take down an adversary’s devices, infrastructure, and tools. By taking the fight to the adversary, it may be possible to make them switch stance: from conducting attacks to defending themselves. These actions ensure cyber security. There needs to be more research on the topic. It is essential to review the scientific literature and see what previous researchers have done and their thoughts at that time. Much information exists today thanks to mainstream media reporting on the topic. And this reporting is thanks to government agencies successfully halting adversary attacks. U.S. Cyber Command has protected the U.S. 2018-midterm elections by dismantling the infrastructure of a Russian troll farm. This example shows how the command for cyberspace can use offensive cyberspace operations to ensure the cyber security of elections. The article aims to raise awareness among policymakers, authorities, and the public about the success of offensive cyberspace operations for cyber security.

How do threat actors exploit vulnerabilities to conduct ransomware attacks? Participate to understand Cyberspace as an operational environment and what to do about threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. The course is based on the military intelligence experiences, private-sector-experiences, and PhD-research on Offensive Cyberspace Operations with a base on intelligence, deterrence and a “young” underdeveloped theory on cyberspace operations. Academic Courses 2021 - Cyber Operations in an Antagonistic Environment. Advanced Level. Swedish Defence University. ABSTRACT: In this course the cyber domain is problematised in order for you to be able to describe and discuss threats, risks and events The course starts with an introduction to computers and networks in order to provide a common frame of reference for the remainder of the course. The second part of the course deals with the Internet, automated systems and the actors that operate in the cyber environment. The distinctive features of the cyber domain compared to traditional military methods are highlighted. 2020 - Cyber Operations in an Antagonistic Environment. Advanced Level.
